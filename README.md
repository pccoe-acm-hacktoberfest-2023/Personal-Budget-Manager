*Personal-Budget-Manager*

*Key Features*:

1.Expense Management: -You can add expenses to specific categories, ensuring the total amount spent is tracked. -It prevents negative expense values from being added.

2.Budget Tracking: -It maintains the total budget and calculates how much of it is left after expenses are made. -It can warn the user if they have exceeded the budget.

3.File Persistence: -The expenses and budget details can be saved to a file and reloaded later for persistence between sessions.

4.Resetting Expenses: -All expenses can be reset, clearing both the tracked spending and the category details.

*Pre-requisites are needed:*

*Basic Python Knowledge*

        -Classes and Objects: Know how to define classes, and instantiate objects (like BudgetManager). 
        
        -Methods: Be able to define and use methods inside a class. 
        
        -Attributes: Learn how to handle class-level and instance-level attributes.

*Exception Handling*

*Command-Line Execution (Optional)*

        -Familiarity with running Python scripts from the command line or terminal.

*Saving and Loading Data* 

        -Basic knowledge of how to store and retrieve data, especially using file formats like plain text, CSV, or JSON, which is used in this code for storing expenses.

*Work flow: Step 1:*

*Initialize the Budget*

        1.User Input: -The user defines an initial budget (e.g., $1000).

        2.System Action: -The program initializes a BudgetManager object with the specified budget, setting spent = 0 and expenses = {} (an empty dictionary to hold categorized expenses).

        3.Expected Outcome: -The budget is set, and the system is ready to track expenses.

*Step 2: Add Expenses*

        1.User Input: 

                -The user adds expenses to different categories (e.g., Groceries: $200, Rent: $600, Entertainment: $300).

        2.System Action: 

                -The add_expense() method is called. 
        
                -It checks if the expense is valid (not negative). 
        
                -It updates the category in the expenses dictionary or adds a new category if it doesn’t exist. 
        
                -The system updates the total spent amount by adding the new expense.

        3.Expected Outcome: 

                -The expense is categorized and added to the running total.

*Step 3: Calculate Remaining Budget*

        1.User Input: 

                -The user requests to see how much of the budget is left.

        2.System Action: 

                -The calculate_remaining_budget() method is called. 

                -The system calculates remaining_budget = budget - spent. 

                -If remaining_budget is negative, a warning is displayed indicating that the user has overspent.

        3.Expected Outcome: 

                -The user sees the remaining balance, and a warning is issued if the budget has been exceeded.
*Step 4: Save Expenses to a File*
        1.User Input:
        
                -The user wants to save the current budget and expense data to a file for later use.
        
        2.System Action:
                
                -The save_to_file() method is called with a filename (e.g., expenses.txt).
                
                -The system writes the current budget, total spent, and each category with its associated expense to the file.
        3.Expected Outcome:
        
                -The expenses are saved in a text file, allowing the user to load them in the future.
                
*Step 5: Reset the Budget*

        1.User Input: 
        
                -The user wants to clear all expenses and start fresh.
        
        2.System Action: 
               
               -The reset_expenses() method is called. 
               
               -The system sets spent = 0 and clears the expenses dictionary.
        
        3.Expected Outcome: 
                
                -All expenses are cleared, and the budget is reset to its initial value.

*Step 6: Load Expenses from a File*

        1.User Input: 
                -The user wants to load previously saved expenses from a file (e.g., expenses.txt).
        
        2.System Action: 
               
                -The load_from_file() method is called with the filename. 
                
                -The system reads the file, retrieves the budget, total spent, and categorized expenses, and updates the program’s state accordingly.
        
        3.Expected Outcome: 
                -The budget, total spent, and categorized expenses are restored from the file.

*Step 7: Error Handling and Warnings*

        1.Negative Expense Warning: 
                
                -If the user tries to add a negative expense, an error message is displayed, and the system prevents the operation.

*Future Plan for Budget Manager:*

1.Core Enhancements:

        -Add subcategories, set category-specific limits, and support multiple budgets.
        
2.Improved User Interaction:

        -Implement input validation, build a GUI, and set up notifications for budget warnings.

3.Advanced Features:

        -Add data visualization (charts), expense forecasting, and automatic import from bank statements.

4.Data Storage:

        -Shift from text files to databases (e.g., SQLite) and consider cloud backups for user data.

5.Security:

        -Add user authentication and encrypt sensitive financial data.
